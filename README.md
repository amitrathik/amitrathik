### Hi there üëãüèæ,

I'm Amit, a developer & entrepreneur. 
Currently, I am working full-time on my own business venture, The Mobile Dev.
Initally, the business was a means to offer my computer programming skills as a service for freelance and contract work. But, with the shift in technologies and the economy, I am making an effort to shift my business model to software-as-a-service. So, I am currently building my own platform. 

Along with my business venture, I am in the process of leveling up my skills. 
I am intrigued with blockchain and crypto, but completely clueless. So, I am hoping to spend some time to build out a couple projects to get some hands-on experience. 

One thought process is figuring out how to add it as a module to some of my old repos.
But first, I need to revisit some of my old projects to modernize them as some are quite old.

This endeavor is a training exercise as I will be refactoring and upgrading an old codebase to the best of my abilities. 

Some projects were built poorly as I was still new to JavaScript, so many used jQuery. Other projects were learning exercises as I was trying to shift into using JavaScript more and so I used the CRA framework to learn React.

Ultimately, I am planning to clean up my repos.
