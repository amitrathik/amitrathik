Damn it, Amit!

Currently, I am working on a multi-project project. I have this ability to overcomplicate a task, seeing the opportunity to challenge myself and develop skills. However, this also causes me to overwhelm myself to a state of paralysis. 
There are other factors to this. But, I admit, it needs to stop. I want to build out my projects and move forward with my other goals in this life.

To avoid worrying about design, I bought an HTML template years ago. I converted it into a WordPress theme, thanks to the experience I gained between self-teaching and my first job as a web developer at AMBR Detroit. 

I had created a couple posts and it was great. But, WordPress seemed like a bit too much for my specific needs, not to much my creative process (a bit non-existant and overly complicated), so I purged the site.

But, I kept the code. I liked the design. But, I also realized I was avoiding creating the content necesary to replace the placeholder content. It's something that I do not recall being talked about when it comes to building out web projects.

People make it seem so easy to buy a template to save time. But, I ended up avoiding the content. But, there was another factor. For my own needs, I wanted a place to write posts, but also share my work. So, I needed to allow myself the time to focus on my portfolio. But, it's not that simple. I needed to iterate on my thoughts and build out projects. 

But, projects took time. Especially because I want to develop them completely. Which takes time and energy. 

I have other goals to tho. One of them being losing weight, so finding time to exercise was critical. Finding time to grocery shop, and cook was also essential. However, I did not have this skill. Which has sent me through a whirlwind of personal development obstacles. Nevertheless, I have moved forward.

It is all coming together.
